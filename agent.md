# Janet: an Openclaw AI assistant

This repo is used to configure Janet, an AI assistant using the
[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) framework.

Review the documentation and do the following:

- Configure the assistant in an isolated Docker environment using Linux.
  - I may install this on a VPS in the future, so use a version of Linux that is
    easy to transfer.
- Install Wordpress
  - Give the bot access to the Agent Skills repo from @automattic
  - Inform the agent that this is my website, I own it, you can do with it what
    you please
- Integrate Janet with the following services:
  - WhatsApp
  - Gmail
  - Provide an example env file that can be used to load credentials.

Plan out the tasks, and proceed after confirming with me.

Ask me follow-up questions if you need more information.
